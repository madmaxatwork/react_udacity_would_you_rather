# Would You Rather Project
**Programming assignment for the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) program.**

The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
Users can only vote once per poll; changing answers after they’ve voted is not allowed. When the user comes back to the home page, the polling question appears in the “Answered” column.
Users can also checkout the leaderboard to see who is the most active user.
